# GAN

It uses the concept of generator and discriminator as a deconvolutional and convolutional neural networks respectively along with other pooling and activation functions to generate random data which is very closely related to the original data used for testing and training from literally from nothing provided to the generator network.

The weights gets updated according to the gradient calculated by the loss functions of both generative and discriminator networks in each iteration. So, the model gets improved gradually after many iterations.
